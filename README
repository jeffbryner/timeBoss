timeBoss

A UI for forensic filtering of filesystem MAC times. 

What? 
    If you've used the sleuthkit to create filesystem timelines
    you know that the result is a treasure-trove of information. 
    
    However, it's usually plain text and difficult to parse beyond
    simple greps without some tools. 
    
    timeBoss is a UI built with python and kivy that makes use of 
    pandas dataframes with timestamp indexing to filter the timeline
    into usable bits. 
    
Install? 
    prerequesites: 
    python 2.7
    pandas: pip install pandas
    kivy: pip install kivy
    
Run? 
    Video Demo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP0D92EIMKY

    python main.py from whatever directory you've downloaded the project to. 
    
    You'll be presented with a file open dialog. Pick a timeline file generated 
    to .csv format ala: 
    
    <assuming a dd disk image of an ntfs drive named sda1.dd> 
    fls -f ntfs -m / -r sda1.dd > sda1.dd.macs
    ils -f ntfs -m  sda1.dd >> sda1.dd.macs
    mactime -b sda1.macs -d > sda1.mactime.csv
    
    
    Once opened (typical win7 install is 20MB worth of macs, 30secs to open)
    you'll see the main interface with years at the bottom, search at the top. 
    
    Click a year and you'll see the time entries for that year. 
    You can search a display by typing something (.exe for example) and pressing
    return. 
    
    Scroll the list or the years by left clicking and dragging or via mouse
    wheel.
