timeBoss

A UI for forensic filtering of filesystem MAC times. 

What? 
    If you've used the sleuthkit to create filesystem timelines
    you know that the result is a treasure-trove of information. 
    
    However, it's usually plain text and difficult to parse beyond
    simple greps without some tools. 
    
    timeBoss is a UI built with python and kivy that makes use of 
    pandas dataframes with timestamp indexing to filter the timeline
    into usable bits. 
    
Install? 
    prerequesites: 
    python 2.7
    pandas: pip install pandas
    kivy: pip install kivy
    
Run? 
    Video Demo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Km_FR-Esk8

    python main.py from whatever directory you've downloaded the project to. 
    
    You'll be presented with a file open dialog. Pick a timeline file generated 
    to .csv format ala: 
    
    <assuming a dd disk image of an ntfs drive named sda1.dd> 
    fls -f ntfs -m / -r sda1.dd > sda1.dd.macs
    ils -f ntfs -m  sda1.dd >> sda1.dd.macs
    mactime -b sda1.macs -d > sda1.mactime.csv
    
Usage:     
    Once opened (typical win7 install is 20MB worth of macs, 30secs to open)
    you'll see the main interface with years at the bottom, search at the top. 
    
    Click a year and you'll see the time entries for that year. 

Filtering: 
    You can search a display by typing something (.exe for example) and pressing
    return.

    Filtering is cumulative. Search 'deleted' and you'll see all deleted files. Search again for 'exe' and you'll
    see only deleted 'exe' files. 

    Enter any recognizable date (1/1, 1/1/2000, 4am, Aug 1st, etc) range to filter results within that range.

    Scroll the list or the years by left clicking and dragging or via mouse
    wheel.
